# Changelog

All notable changes to claude-mem-lite are documented in this file.

## [2.11.2] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed
- Stopped `setup.sh` from clearing marketplace `.mcp.json` on every SessionStart, which caused MCP server registration to disappear after plugin updates. Claude Code copies `.mcp.json` from marketplace → cache, so clearing the marketplace copy broke the chain.

## [2.10.4] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- Made plugin SessionStart MCP cleanup idempotent so old direct-install `mem` entries in `~/.claude.json` are removed even if an earlier migration marker already exists.
- Added a regression test covering stale global `mem` cleanup when older dedup markers are present.

## [2.10.3] - 2026-03-16

### Fixed
- Restored real Claude Code plugin MCP registration by moving `.mcp.json` back to the plugin root, which is the location Claude Code actually loads for marketplace installs.
- Kept duplicate-avoidance focused on removing stale global `mem` registrations and stale marketplace copies instead of moving the plugin MCP manifest out of the root.

## [2.10.1] - 2026-03-16

### Changed
- Moved the MCP source manifest to `claude-plugin/.mcp.json` in the repository as a first step toward removing marketplace-root duplication.

## [2.10.0] - 2026-03-16

### Changed
- Moved the plugin-mode MCP manifest to `.claude-plugin/.mcp.json` so the package layout matches Claude Code's plugin loader behavior.
- Aligned release metadata across `package.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

### Fixed
- Duplicate `mem` MCP registration caused by a root-level `.mcp.json` being loaded through both marketplace root scanning and plugin cache loading.
- Stale pre-2.10 marketplace installs now clear the old root `.mcp.json` and legacy global `mem` registration during migration.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **v3 intelligent skill/agent dispatch system** — 3-tier progressive architecture (fast filter, context signals, FTS5 retrieval, Haiku semantic fallback)
- Closed-loop feedback tracking for dispatch recommendations (adoption + outcome scoring)
- Resource registry database with FTS5 indexing for skills/agents
- Registry scanner, indexer, and retriever modules
- Comprehensive test suite: 470 tests across 14 files (smoke, contract, unit, integration, property, E2E)
- Property-based tests via fast-check (Jaccard, MinHash, FTS5 invariants)
- Benchmark infrastructure with CI regression gate (5% tolerance)
- Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) for query expansion
- Concept co-occurrence expansion for improved recall
- Directory-level re-ranking with active file overlap
- Adaptive time windows based on session activity velocity
- Semantic synonym expansion (48+ pairs) in FTS5 queries
- FTS5 snippets in search results
- Fact extraction from observations
- Token-budgeted observation selection for session-start injection
- Structured logging (`debugLog`/`debugCatch`) gated by `CLAUDE_MEM_DEBUG`
- MinHash signature-based cross-session deduplication (7-day window)
- Observation compression (`mem_compress`) for archiving old entries
- Access count tracking with logarithmic boost in search scoring
- Zod schema validation for all MCP tool inputs
- Contract tests ensuring schema compliance
- Plugin marketplace support (`.claude-plugin/`)
- `doctor` and `status` CLI commands for diagnostics
- Bilingual README (English + Chinese)
- `CLAUDE_MEM_DIR` environment variable for custom data directory

### Changed
- Renamed database from `claude-mem.db` to `claude-mem-lite.db` (auto-migration on startup)
- Refactored monolithic `hook.mjs` into focused modules: `hook-episode.mjs`, `hook-context.mjs`, `hook-semaphore.mjs`, `hook-shared.mjs`, `hook-llm.mjs`
- Consolidated database schema into single-source-of-truth `initSchema()` in `schema.mjs`
- Extracted shared utilities to `utils.mjs` (Jaccard, MinHash, secret scrubbing, Bash analysis)
- Upgraded BM25 column weights for better relevance ranking
- Improved recency decay formula (14-day half-life)

### Fixed
- N+1 queries in observation retrieval
- TOCTOU race conditions in episode buffer and lock management
- SQL injection prevention: all queries parameterized, FTS5 identifiers validated
- Stale lock file recovery (PID-aware + timeout-based cleanup)
- Session deduplication before unique index creation (migration safety)
- Large stdin silent discard (256KB truncation with regex salvage)
- Compress summary drift across weekly boundaries
- FTS5 query sanitization for special characters and boolean keywords
- Cold start behavior (graceful when no observations exist)
- Project isolation in cross-session dedup
- Semaphore atomicity for concurrent LLM calls

### Security
- Secret scrubbing: 15+ credential patterns (AWS, OpenAI, GitHub, GitLab, Slack, JWT, PEM, DB URLs, Stripe, npm)
- Atomic writes (tmp + rename) prevent data corruption on crash
- SIGTERM/SIGINT signal handlers flush episode buffers safely
- File path sanitization prevents directory traversal
- Error messages scrubbed of stack traces before user-facing output

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-20

### Added
- Initial release of claude-mem-lite
- MCP server with 7 tools: `mem_search`, `mem_timeline`, `mem_get`, `mem_save`, `mem_stats`, `mem_delete`, `mem_compress`
- Hook system: PostToolUse, PreToolUse, SessionStart, Stop, UserPromptSubmit
- Episode batching (10 entries or 5-minute gap) for efficient LLM encoding
- FTS5 full-text search with BM25 ranking
- Background LLM workers (Haiku) for observation encoding
- Graceful degradation: saves with inferred metadata when LLM fails
- SQLite WAL mode for concurrent access
- Bash pre-filter (~5ms) for noise suppression
- User prompt capture and scrubbing
- Error-triggered recall (searches memory on Bash failures)
- Proactive file history on edit operations
- CLAUDE.md context injection at session start
- Three installation methods: plugin marketplace, npx, git clone
- Smart installer with migration from original claude-mem
